# Career-Track-Prep-Code_Challenges

1. Basics - Object literals give us some new faster and simpler ways to convey code.
2. Computed Properties - Object literal properties can by computed, a result of function calls, or constructed by an expression. Never got the accessor key one so not sure what to think about that.
3. Creation - how to use create classes, use constructors and methods within the class body.
4. Statics - as simple as pre-fixing the method name with “static”, including getters.
5. Extends - the keyword extend allows classes to inherit properties from others.
6. Array Destructuring - allows us to make shorter code using tools such as brackets, leading commas and nested arrays.
7. String Destructuring - very similar to array restructuring using leading commas.
8. Object Destructuring - this one was really out there, and I’m not really sure how I got through it. Lots of trial and error but I can’t say that I really understood much of it.
9. Destructuring with Defaults - we can add defaults values while destructuring by simply saying “[a=1]”.
10. Destructuring Function Parameters - this was another strange one. Maybe when I see this in action it’ll make more sense but I’m not sure what I did here.
11. Destructuring Assign - learning how to assign new property names using colons.
12. Rest as a parameter - …rest collects the remaining arguments and groups them in an array that can be accessed through any of the array properties.
13. Rest with destructuring - using the …rest notation with destructuring to simplify parameter assignments and constructors.
14. Array Spread - close to opposite of rest but it literally spreads the array into it’s elements while rest condenses multiple items into one.
15. Function Defaults - adding defaults help us to avoid errors when parameters are not given a value and they’re only used when values are not actually given.
